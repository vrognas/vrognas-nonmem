## [0.0.1] — 2026-05-02

### Added

- Repo scaffold (M0): TypeScript + esbuild + vitest + eslint + prettier; mirrors the
  sven / redmyne / vscode-nmtran convention.
- `positronNonmem.testConnection` command (M1): opens an SSH connection to the
  configured host (alias-only logging), runs `uname -a`, surfaces output in the
  "Positron NONMEM" channel.
- `host-profiles.ts` with `${env:VAR}` indirection so hostnames never land in committed
  configs.
- `ssh-transport.ts` wrapping the ssh2 library; supports `ssh-agent` and `ssh-key` auth.
- Vitest unit tests for env-var expansion, home-directory expansion, and host-profile
  validation.
